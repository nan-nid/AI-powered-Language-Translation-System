AIM: AI-powered-Language-Translation-System

Project Description: The AI-Powered Language Translation System uses the MarianMT model from Hugging Face for accurate translations between English, Hindi, and French. It features both text and speech recognition inputs, enhancing accessibility and interaction quality. By integrating automatic speech recognition (ASR), it enables real-time spoken language translation. Optimized for speed and accuracy, the system supports seamless multilingual communication for education, business, and global use.

Prerequisite Skill: Python programming, TensorFlow or PyTorch 

Techiques Used: speech-to-text, text to speech, online translation, GUI, multithreading, language & accent customization and preventative maintenance

Dataset Used: Diverse Multilingual Datasets

Conclusion: The development of the AI-powered translation system represents a significant advancement in overcoming the challenges faced by traditional translation methods. By integrating cutting-edge machine learning and natural language processing techniques, this system aims to deliver accurate, context-aware translations that cater to the diverse needs of global communication.
